## Introduction 
This project designed to ingest and transform data from multiple sources (CRM and ERP systems) into Snowflake. It follows the Medallion Architecture to structure data efficiently for analytics. The pipeline leverages dbt (Data Build Tool) to transform raw data into analytics-ready datasets, ensuring high-quality, governed, and optimized data models for reporting and business intelligence.



## Tech Stack & Tools
- **DBT (Data Build Tool)**: For building and transforming data models.
- **Snowflake**: As the data warehouse.
- **Tableau** : For visualizing the reporting layer.

## Pipeline Architecture 

[end to end data warehouse project using dbt.pdf](https://github.com/user-attachments/files/19399620/end.to.end.data.warehouse.project.using.dbt.pdf)



The project follows the Medallion Architecture, which organizes data into three layers:

    Bronze Layer (Raw Data): Stores unprocessed and ingested data from various sources.
    Silver Layer (Cleansed Data): Cleans and pre-processes data for transformation and enrichment.
    Gold Layer (Aggregated Data): Optimized for analytics, reporting, and business intelligence.
